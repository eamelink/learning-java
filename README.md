Learning Java
===

This is a set of Java applications, to build your Java skills. These applications can typically be made without supervision, but an experienced Java developer should be consulted whenever you get stuck or have questions. Also, an experienced Java developer must review every single application that you made and provide you with feedback. After feedback, the application should be improved and reviewed again until it's of a high quality.

 Each application has instructions on what to do, and what to pay attention to. Most applications will have several progressions, so that you can slowly build up to the final application. Don't hesitate to ask a review of an intermediate state!
